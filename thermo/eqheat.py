To solve for the temperature distribution within an aluminum bar of length L = 1m that is subject to
the boudnary and initial conditions: T(x=0, t) = T(x=L, t) = 0 K and T(x, t=0) == 100K. The corresponding
thermal conductivity is 237W/mK, specific heat is 900 J/(kgK), and the aluminum density is 2700 kg/m^3.
