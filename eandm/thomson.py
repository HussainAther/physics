When an electromnagetic wave hits a charged particle, the electric and magneitc components of the wave
exert a Lorentz force on the particle and may set it into motion. The particle absorbs the energy
and re-emits electromagnetic radiation in a process of scattering known as Thomson scattering.

If we integrate the emission coefficient (ε) that describes the radially polarized light.
ε dt dV dΩ dλ is the energy scattered by a volume dV into time dt into a solid angle dΩ for a wavelength increase dλ.

For unpolarized light, ε can be divided into ε_t and ε_r .

ε_t = ((π σ_t)/2) In

ε_r = ((π σ_t)/2) In * cos(χ)^2

in which n is the density n of the charged particles at the scattering point, I is the incident flux,
and σ_t is the Thomson cross section for the charged particle. χ is the angle between incident and observed waves.
