"""
When an electromnagetic wave hits a charged particle, the electric and magneitc components of the wave
exert a Lorentz force on the particle and may set it into motion. The particle absorbs the energy
and re-emits electromagnetic radiation in a process of scattering known as Thomson scattering.

If we integrate the emission coefficient (ε) that describes the radially polarized light.
ε dt dV dΩ dλ is the energy scattered by a volume dV into time dt into a solid angle dΩ for a wavelength increase dλ.
